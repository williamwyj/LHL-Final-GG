'Super Monkey Ball', 
'Super Monkey Ball is a 2001 platform party video game developed by Amusement Vision and published by Sega. The game debuted in Japan at

distinctive banana-shaped analog stick. Due to the failure of Sega''s Dreamcast home console and the company''s subsequent restructuring, 
an enhanced port dubbed Super Monkey Ball was released as a launch title for the GameCube in late 2001, garnering interest as Sega''s first 
game published for a Nintendo home console.',
